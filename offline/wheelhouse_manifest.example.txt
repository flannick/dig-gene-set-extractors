# Example wheelhouse manifest for offline installation (Python 3.10+)
#
# Include at least these direct packages:
# - setuptools
# - wheel
# - build
# - jsonschema
# - pytest   (if using .[dev])
#
# Include transitive dependencies for your target Python/OS as well.
# A practical way to build this wheelhouse on a connected machine is:
#
#   python -m pip download --dest /path/to/wheelhouse \
#     setuptools wheel build jsonschema pytest
#
# Then copy the wheelhouse directory to the offline machine and run:
#
#   scripts/install_offline.sh --wheelhouse /path/to/wheelhouse
#
# You can sanity-check it with:
#
#   scripts/check_wheelhouse.py --wheelhouse /path/to/wheelhouse --with-dev
